# 📁 103.3 Perform Basic File Management

## 🧠 Description
In this lab, I practiced using essential Linux commands to manage files and directories as outlined in LPIC-1 Objective 103.3. I created and organized files into directories, then used commands like cp, mv, rm, and rmdir to copy, move, and remove files and folders, including recursive operations. I explored wildcard usage to manipulate multiple files at once and used the find command to locate files based on name, size, and modification time. Additionally, I learned how to archive directories with tar and cpio, compress files using tools like gzip, and create raw data files with dd. These hands-on tasks helped reinforce my understanding of basic file management, which is a critical skill in Linux system administration.

I’ve included some helpful links to guide you through the lab and for studying afterward:

## 6️⃣ 🔹 Archiving and Compression

🔹 Create a tar archive:

🔹 Compress the archive with gzip:

🔹 Decompress it:

🔹 Use cpio to archive files:

🔹 Use dd to copy raw data:

## 📚 What I Learned
Through this lab, I gained hands-on experience with essential file management tasks in Linux. I learned how to structure directories, move and copy files intelligently, search using find, and use archiving and compression tools to manage data. These are foundational skills I’ll use in nearly every Linux admin role. 🧑‍💻✨
