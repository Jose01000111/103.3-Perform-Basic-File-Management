# 📁 103.3 Perform Basic File Management

## 🧠 Description
In this lab, I practiced using essential Linux commands to manage files and directories as outlined in LPIC-1 Objective 103.3. I created and organized files into directories, then used commands like cp, mv, rm, and rmdir to copy, move, and remove files and folders, including recursive operations. I explored wildcard usage to manipulate multiple files at once and used the find command to locate files based on name, size, and modification time. Additionally, I learned how to archive directories with tar and cpio, compress files using tools like gzip, and create raw data files with dd. These hands-on tasks helped reinforce my understanding of basic file management, which is a critical skill in Linux system administration.
